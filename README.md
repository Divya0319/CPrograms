# CPrograms
C Programs for some usecases, following a different approach.

#### It contains the following programs - 

  ##### 1. Implementation of a stack using linked list data structure in C. (https://github.com/Divya0319/CPrograms/blob/master/stackusingll.c)
   
  
   This program demonstrates the stack operations like PUSH and POP and also shows the whole stack alongwith top element of the stack after every operation.
  ##### 2. Counting the number of invocations of recursive call to Tower of Hanoi Movement (https://github.com/Divya0319/CPrograms/blob/master/tohsolution.c)
  
  
   It takes the number of discs present in Tower of Hanoi as arguement from the user. It then does the movement of the discs to solve TOH problem using recursion.
   Also it shows the outcome of every movement at each step. In the end, it displays total number of recursive calls are done to achieve the solution(using pointers).
  
   
  ##### 3. Counting the number of invocations of recursive call to Tower of Hanoi Movement (https://github.com/Divya0319/CPrograms/blob/master/tohsolutionincpp.cpp)


   It performs in exactly the same way as the above TOH problem implemented using C, only difference is that while calling the tower of hanoi method here, "pass by reference" approach is used for counting the number of method invocations in recursion.
